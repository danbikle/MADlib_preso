This model lacks the ability to predict down days.

This is somewhat expected because the model was built after
I noticed Mean Reversion behavior and used that analysis
to design my training vectors.

Mean Reversion works better at predicting up days than at predicting down days.

Also, the vector length I'm using in this model is only 2.

And, the only 'pure' information used in my vector design is price.

I ignore other sources of information like volume, sentiment,
calendar events, interest rates, energy prices, currency behavior, and media events.

The good news is that I see a strong correlation between prediction
confidence levels and corresponding gains.

For example when confidence is at
